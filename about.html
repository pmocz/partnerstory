						This game is based on a story writing game I used to play as a kid with family and friends at school using pencil and paper.
						Many people I know now live physically apart. So I decided to put together a simple version you can play online. I hope you and a friend might have some fun writing creative and silly stories with this game too!

						The source code may be found on github at the link below. It is written using html5 and javascript and uses PeerJS to establish peer-to-peer connections between players. Please feel free to fork the code and use or modify it however you wish.

						I am a computational astrophysicist and I put together this game in my free time. Server space at the moment is limited. If you experience issues or have questions, you may <a href="mailto:philip.mocz@gmail.com">email me</a>. This is just a small hobby project so I may be slow at getting back to you.

						If you like the game, please consider supporting me to help produce future projects like this.
